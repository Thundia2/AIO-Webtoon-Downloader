// ============================================================
// CHECK-ALL SWEEP RECORD (main-process, canonical)
//
// Owns the authoritative state of the library "Check All" update sweep: which
// run is live, every row it has produced, and the progress counters.
// electron/main.js's check-all-updates handler drives it; the
// get-update-check-state IPC serves its snapshot.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS: the sweep runs in the main process and keeps running when
// the renderer's Library tab unmounts — which App.jsx does on every tab
// switch. Before this, the renderer held the ONLY copy of the scan, so a tab
// switch destroyed it and the next "Check All" click aborted the live sweep
// and restarted from zero. The renderer is a mirror now
// (src/hooks/useUpdateCheck.js); this is the record it re-reads.
//
// TWO INVARIANTS THIS MODULE EXISTS TO HOLD:
//   1. ONE reducer. Rows are derived here (resultRow) and shipped whole, so a
//      snapshot handed to a remounting tab and a live event can never
//      disagree about a series.
//   2. ONE live run. Every emission is stamped with a runId and DROPPED when
//      it belongs to a superseded run — a forced rescan preempts workers that
//      are still awaiting Python, and their late "completed"/"done" events
//      would otherwise land in the new run's rows and flip it to done at ~0%.
//
// NOT PERSISTED: the sweep dies with the process, so a record that outlived
// it could only ever describe a scan nothing is driving.
//
// Offline regression: tools/_test_update_check_record.js
// ============================================================

// Derive the panel row from one per-series check result.
//
// `base` carries the identity/display fields the handler already knows
// (folderPath, title, cover, site, enqueuedAt) and is rebuilt per event
// rather than inherited from the previous row — that is what stops an
// "uptodate" row from still carrying the newChapters of a "found" one.
//
// `r` is the _checkSeriesUpdates result: { error } | { ok, newChapters,
// ignoredChapters, total, ... }. Cross-file: main.js:_checkSeriesUpdates
// builds it.
//
// IGNORED CHAPTERS RIDE BOTH NON-ERROR BRANCHES. They are chapters the user
// crossed out, so they must never count toward "found" — a series whose only
// missing chapters are crossed out IS up to date, and the panel's badge, its
// section count and "Queue all" all key off that state. But the row still
// carries them in either state, because the panel renders them struck through
// and the undo lives on that same row: dropping them from the uptodate branch
// would make a fully-crossed-out series impossible to restore.

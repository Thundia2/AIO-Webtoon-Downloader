// ============================================================
// CHAPTER CHIPS — per-chapter controls for the update-check surfaces
//
// One chip per chapter an update check reported as missing. A chip carries TWO
// separate gestures, and the difference between them is SCOPE:
//
//   TICK — click the chip body. Changes what THIS download queues, nothing
//     else. Lives in the calling panel's own state, is never written to disk,
//     and is gone the moment the panel closes or a new sweep starts. It exists
//     so "grab 1-3 now, the rest later" doesn't require crossing anything out.
//
//   CROSS OUT — click the ×. Writes .aio_series.json:chapters_ignored (via
//     useUpdateCheck.setRowIgnored → main's set-chapters-ignored IPC). Survives
//     app restarts. The chapter keeps being REPORTED by every future check —
//     struck through, with an undo arrow — but no download button will ever
//     queue it until it is restored.
//
// In one line: tick means "not in this batch", cross out means "not until I say
// otherwise". Both are reversible, which is why neither one HIDES the chapter.
//
// The glyphs carry that distinction, because two identical-looking buttons on
// one chip is exactly how a user ends up unsure which does what: the tick side
// shows a real checkbox (ticked / empty), and a crossed-out chip loses the
// checkbox entirely — it is no longer part of the selection at all, so offering
// it a tick would be a lie. ChapterChipsLegend below is the words for the same
// distinction, exported so both surfaces say it identically.
//
// Shared by the two places a check result is rendered, so they can't drift:
//   - components/UpdatesCenter.jsx  — the "Check All" panel's expanded row
//   - components/LibraryTab.jsx     — one series' detail-view UpdateSection
// Colors stick to the orange "new chapter" accent both surfaces already use
// plus the shared HSL tokens, so it reads native in either.

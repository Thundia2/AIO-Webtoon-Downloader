// ============================================================
// useUpdateCheck — "Check All" sweep state, held ABOVE the tab switch
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS: App.jsx renders tab bodies conditionally
// ({activeTab === "library" && <LibraryTab/>}), so LibraryTab UNMOUNTS the
// moment the user clicks Queue. All of this state used to be useState inside
// LibraryTab, so a tab switch wiped the rows, the progress counter and the
// grid's "+N new" badges, and dropped the onUpdateCheckProgress subscription
// so everything the still-running sweep emitted while away went nowhere.
// Coming back showed a pristine "Check All" button, and pressing it restarted
// a scan that was already 20 series deep. Living in useDownloader (mounted
// once, for the app's lifetime) is what fixes that — same reason
// libraryEntries and the thumbnail stream were lifted there.
//
// STATE OWNERSHIP: main.js is the record (grep _updateCheckRun), this hook is
// the live mirror. Rows arrive fully-derived on `event.row` — there is no
// second copy of the "is this found / uptodate / error" reducer here, which
// is what lets a get-update-check-state snapshot and a live event agree.
//
// STARTUP ORDERING: the snapshot IPC and the event stream race, so events
// that arrive before the snapshot resolves are BUFFERED and drained after it
// (grep `hydrated` in the subscribe effect). Snapshot-then-events is the only
// ordering where both sources compose without any merge rules — which is why
// adoptSnapshot can be a plain overwrite.
//
// KNOWN LIMIT: rows the user queues or dismisses are resolved here only —
// main's record still calls them "found". A window reload mid-sweep would
// therefore resurrect a dismissed row. Packaged builds expose no reload, and
// paying an IPC round-trip per dismiss to close a devtools-only hole isn't
// worth it; revisit if a reload path ever ships.
//
// setRowIgnored is the exception and does NOT share that limit: crossing a
// chapter out writes .aio_series.json, so it survives a reload, the app
// closing, and every future sweep — that persistence is the feature, not an
// implementation detail. It is also the only action here that talks to disk;
// resolveRows (queue / dismiss) stays session-local on purpose, because
// "I've seen this" is not the same claim as "never offer me this".
//
// Cross-file:
//   - electron/main.js  — check-all-updates / get-update-check-state /
//                         cancel-check-all-updates handlers + the record
//   - electron/preload.js — event shapes are documented on
//                         onUpdateCheckProgress
//   - hooks/useDownloader.js — instantiates this and re-exports it as
//                         `updateCheck`
//   - components/LibraryTab.jsx — consumes it; owns only the panel's
//                         open/closed flag
//   - components/UpdatesCenter.jsx — renders the rows

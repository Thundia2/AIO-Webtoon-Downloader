"""Android (Chaquopy) entry point.

What this module owns: every difference between "aio-dl.py run as a CLI on a
desktop" and "aio-dl.py run in-process inside an Android app". Nothing in the
rest of the tree imports this file — it imports them. That direction is the
whole point: desktop must not grow an Android dependency.

Who reads from it: the Kotlin side, via Chaquopy
(`Python.getInstance().getModule("aio_android")`).

Depends on: aio-dl.py (lazily — see _aio_dl), sites.browser_backend,
library_state, aio_config.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHY A SHIM AT ALL

aio-dl.py's main() is ~5,500 lines driven entirely by argparse, with the
download engine living in closures inside it. There is no library API to call.
Rather than refactor that (huge diff, huge regression risk, zero desktop
upside), this module drives it the way the CLI does — build an argv, call
main() — and fixes up the four things that assumption breaks on Android:

  1. CWD. aio-dl.py resolves several paths relative to it (`tmp_<hid>`,
     build_epub's staging dir). Chaquopy's CWD is not writable and not
     predictable, so configure() sets one.
  2. Cancellation. Desktop cancels by killing the process. In-process there
     is nothing to kill, so we flip aio-dl.py's cooperative _RUN_CANCEL.
  3. Progress. Desktop scrapes stdout with regexes. In-process we install a
     structured event sink instead.
  4. The browser. Patchright cannot run here; a WebView can. We register a
     BrowserBackend so the vrf signer and the Cloudflare solver keep working.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE JNI BOUNDARY

Chaquopy marshals str/int/bool/float across JNI painlessly. Python keyword
arguments, dicts, and lists of dicts do NOT survive that trip cleanly from a
Java/Kotlin object. So the Kotlin bridge implements a deliberately dumb
POSITIONAL, PRIMITIVES-ONLY interface and _WebViewBackend below adapts it to
the richer BrowserBackend protocol:

    forProfile(profile: String) -> ProfileBridge          // one browser session
      .goto(url: String, timeoutMs: Int) -> Unit
      .evaluate(script: String, argJson: String) -> String   // "" == no arg; returns JSON
      .content() -> String
      .waitForSelector(selector: String, timeoutMs: Int) -> Boolean
      .userAgent() -> String
      .cookies(url: String) -> String                        // raw "a=b; c=d" header
      .solveChallenge(url: String, timeoutMs: Int) -> String  // JSON {cookies, userAgent}

Everything structured crosses as a JSON string. Keep it that way — the moment
this boundary grows a Python-shaped argument it stops working from Kotlin.

`forProfile` is the ONE structural concession, and it earns its place: Android
has a single Chromium, but the profile names sites/browser_backend.py hands out
("mangafire", "fetch", "cf") are genuinely separate SESSIONS. MangaFire's signer
bootstraps `window.__aioMfSign` into a live page and reuses it for the whole
run, so an unrelated fetch_html_playwright navigation sharing that WebView would
wipe it — intermittently, depending on which sites a run happened to touch.
Cookies stay shared across all of them regardless (CookieManager is
process-global), which is what makes one solved challenge count everywhere.

    installs the bridge). The five lossy controls — `--format epub`,
    `--format pdf`, `--width`, `--scaling < 100`, `--quality < 100` — plus the
    `--webtoon-recompress` switch are still ungated, which is the user-facing
    half of PARITY.md D3/D4 and belongs to the Kotlin settings arm. Written as
    fact, that sentence told the next reader the UI half was closed while the
    recompress switch still promises "around 90% smaller" with nothing checking.

    The key names ARE intended as the contract for that future consumer:

        pillow_webp_decode      Pillow's OWN codec is present (features.check).
        pillow_webp_encode      Pillow's OWN saver is registered — i.e. NOT ours.
        bridge_formats          what the host codec declares it can decode.
        bridge_installed        formats actually shimmed into PIL.
        effective_webp          WebP works by SOME route, read AND write. One
                                key is honest here because the shim installs the
                                WebP opener and saver together.
        effective_avif_decode   AVIF can be READ by some route.
        effective_avif_encode   AVIF can be WRITTEN. Split from decode because
                                they really differ: `Bitmap.CompressFormat` has
                                no AVIF, so the bridge registers an AVIF opener
                                and no saver. The old single `effective_avif`
                                reported True on a device that would raise
                                KeyError('AVIF') on write — measured on API 35.

    rendering the user's typed `imageWorkers` while every run used the preset's
    — android/PARITY.md D9, a display that is simply false. The desktop has had
    the matching affordance since Resource Limits shipped (the lock icon and

# THE BUG THIS EXISTS TO FIX, which is a run-killer and not a nicety: with
# `nargs="+"` argparse keeps consuming tokens until it meets the next option, so
# whenever one of these is the LAST flag before the positional URL, argparse
# swallows the URL as a group name and aio-dl.py dies with "You must provide at
# least one URL". Reachable today from an ordinary form — a user who sets only a
# preferred group and leaves every other knob at its default produces exactly
# `--group A <url>`. Measured against the real parser, all three of
# `--group "A, B" <url>`, `--group A --group B <url>` and
# `--group A --exclude-group B <url>` lose the URL, so the repeated-flag form
# alone does NOT fix it.
#
# The `=` form does: `--group=A` attaches the value to the option token, which
# nargs cannot reach past. One flag per name, so a name arrives as its own
# argparse entry rather than depending on main()'s later `group_string.split(",")`
# (grep it in aio-dl.py) — the same shape _append_saved_update_options emits on
# the --update-all replay path. It also makes a name that starts with "-" safe,
# which the detached form does not.
#
# NOT a fix for a group name that CONTAINS a comma: main() splits every value on
# commas after parsing, so that ambiguity is the CLI's own and cannot be closed
# from the emitting side.

# four watchdog defaults are additionally read from env vars in aio-dl.py's
# argparse (AIO_CHAPTER_DEADLINE, AIO_CHAPTER_HOST_POISON,
# AIO_INLINE_CHAPTER_RETRIES, AIO_INLINE_CHAPTER_BACKOFF), so an OMITTED flag
# also lets an env override stand where an emitted one would silently beat it.

    TWO RETURN SHAPES, and the caller MUST branch on which it got:

        { "error": "unsupported_site", … }        refusal — a JSON OBJECT

    The array is exactly what run_download_json takes, so Kotlin can log the
    command line and then run it without touching the list. The object carries
    `error` ("unsupported_site"), `site` (the handler name), `url`, and
    `message` — a finished, user-facing sentence, so the UI renders it rather
    than composing its own wording from the code.

    DISCRIMINATE ON THE FIRST CHARACTER. `{` and `[` are the only two openers
    either shape can start with, which makes this a one-line branch with no
    speculative parse:

        if (raw.startsWith("[")) JSONArray(raw)          // run it
        else JSONObject(raw).getString("message")        // show it

    WHY AN OBJECT rather than letting the exception cross JNI: Chaquopy turns a
    Python raise into a PyException whose message is a stringified traceback.
    That is a crash to Kotlin, not a thing a Compose screen can render, and the
    one case this fires for — a pasted comix link — is an ordinary user mistake
    that deserves a sentence, not a stack trace.

    Cross-file: DownloadService.kt currently does a bare `JSONArray(...)` on
    this result and would throw on the object; SearchScreen/DownloadScreen are
    the natural places to surface `message`.

#
# Behavioural port of UI-source/electron/searcher.js:buildSearchArgs, run the
# same way list_chapters runs --list-chapters: in-process, stdout captured. The
# `--search-json` contract is a {"candidates": [...]} dict on every successful
# exit (aio_search_cli.py, grep json_output), and an EMPTY candidate list is a
# legitimate "no results" — distinct from the error shapes returned here.
#
# Two mobile-specific departures from the desktop args, both deliberate:
#
#   1. comix is force-excluded. It is the one handler that never went through
#      the browser seam — it drives its own Patchright session
#      (_comix_worker_loop), which does not exist on Android. Its search() is
#      required to swallow failures to [] rather than raise (CLAUDE.md), so
#      leaving it in would not break the run; it would just spend the fan-out's
#      soft-barrier budget failing. Excluding it also keeps it out of the image
#      -quality probe, which is the expensive half.
#   2. search parallelism defaults BELOW the desktop's 6. The fan-out opens one
#      TLS connection per site; a phone radio handles that worse than an
#      ethernet NIC, and the Resource Limits presets tighten it further.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Search-capable handlers that cannot work in this process, regardless of user
# settings.
#
# EXACTLY ONE ENTRY, and the two names this comment used to promise as "coming"
# were both wrong — the tuple never contained them and, measured, neither
# belongs:
#
#   weebcentral — its fallback ladder is `cloudscraper -> rescue_cf_html ->
#       raise` now, and rescue_cf_html's SECOND tier is the embedder browser,
#       i.e. this app's WebView bridge. So weebcentral rescues itself HERE. The
#       old "hard-raises without impit" rationale described the pre-2026-08
#       hand-ordered ladder; impit is genuinely absent on Android (see the
#       "NOT INSTALLED" list in android/app/build.gradle.kts), which only means
#       rescue_cf_html's first tier no-ops and the WebView tier takes it.
#   kagane — not search-capable on EITHER platform. It never overrides
#       BaseSiteHandler.search, so sites.iter_search_capable_handlers() filters
#       it out before the fan-out and `--disable-sites kagane` would be inert.
#       Its pywidevine dependency gates DOWNLOADS, which is a different list.
#
# Verify both claims:
#   python -c "import sites; n={h.name for h in sites.iter_search_capable_handlers()}; print({s: s in n for s in ('comix','weebcentral','kagane')})"

# downloading into it. Before these there was no in-place repair path of ANY
# kind on the device: a series enriched against the wrong AniList entry, or an
# archive the overwrite guard declined to rebuild, stayed that way forever.
#
# Both follow list_chapters' shape rather than run_download's — engine lock
# try-acquired (a repair that silently queued behind a 40-minute download would
# look like a dead button), stdout captured (under Chaquopy stdout IS logcat),
# a JSON verdict returned. Neither streams progress events: aio-dl.py's _emit
# sites are all in the download path, so there is nothing to stream, and the
# captured log is what a UI shows instead.
#
# NEITHER OPTS INTO INTERACTIVE CLOUDFLARE SOLVING, contrary to what a reading
# of "it reaches main(), so it opts in" would suggest. main()'s grant sits at
# the handler-resolution stage (grep allow_interactive_solving_for_this_run),
# and both of these modes sys.exit/return well before it — the refresh from its
# dispatch near the top of main(), build-final-file from the multi-URL runner.
# _run_engine's interactive_solving(False) barrier holds regardless.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    `.aio_series.json` (and each chapter CBZ's ComicInfo.xml under
    `rewrite_cbz`). A series that does not match is left untouched.

    `folder_filter` restricts the sweep to series whose folder name or source
    URL contains it, case-insensitively — the repair-one-series path, and the
    documented cure for a poisoned AniList match (root CLAUDE.md, the
    cached-ID self-heal). Empty sweeps everything.
    `force_refresh` bypasses the cached anilist_id, for when AniList itself
    re-tagged the series.
    `tag_min_rank` is the AniList relevance floor for the tags that land in
    ComicInfo/details.json; 50 is aio-dl.py's own default.

    NOT GATED ON `--metadata-source`, which is worth knowing because it looks
    like it should be: `_refresh_library_metadata` imports and calls
    `enrich_from_anilist` directly and never reads that flag, so a repair works
    even on a device where enrichment is switched off for live downloads.
    Emitting `--metadata-source` here would therefore be inert, and it is not
    emitted — `configure(metadata_source=…)` and build_argv's flag are what
    govern LIVE downloads.

    "exitCode": N, "output": "<log tail>"}`, or one of:
      {"error": "engine_busy"}    a download holds the engine
      {"error": "not_configured"} configure() has not run
      {"error": "refresh_failed", "detail": "..."}  the engine raised

    `matched`/`skipped`/`failed` are parsed out of the mode's own summary line
    and are absent-as-zero when it printed none (an empty library, or a filter
    that matched nothing) — `output` is the authoritative record either way,
    which is why it is always returned.

    REWRITE_CBZ IS I/O-HEAVY: it repackages every chapter archive in every

    `--build-final-file` globs `*.pdf` in the folder, groups the matches by the
    `<Series Title> Ch <n>.pdf` name shape, and merges each group — grep
    build_final_pdf_from_chapter_folder in aio-dl.py. There is no CBZ or EPUB
    branch, so a CBZ library gets `{"ok": true, "built": 0}` and a log line
    saying no per-chapter PDFs were found. DO NOT present this as the recovery
    for a skipped CBZ/EPUB rebuild; aio-dl.py's own guard prints the two
    remedies separately for exactly this reason (grep _final_file_would_shrink
    and read the two print() calls under the "partial_coverage" branch — the
    `--build-final-file` hint is inside `if args.format == "pdf"`).

    WHAT IT IS THE RECOVERY FOR: the archive-overwrite guard now KEEPS an
    existing combined file when a run would shrink it, and emits
    `final_file_skipped`. For a PDF series whose per-chapter files are still on
    disk (`--keep-chapters`), this is the "recombine it now" button. For cbz and
    epub the honest instruction is to re-run the URL with the full chapter
    range, and a UI must say that instead of offering this.

    Returns `{"ok": true, "built": N, "files": [...], "exitCode": N,
    "output": "..."}` or an error object (`engine_busy`, `not_configured`,
    `outside_library`, `not_found`, `build_failed`).

    Containment-guarded like [delete_series]: the mode WRITES `<prefix>.pdf`
    into the folder it is given, and that path has crossed JSON and JNI to get

# Resume
#
# Behavioural port of UI-source/electron/downloader.js:scanResumable + resume().
# Both sides look for the same thing: a `tmp_<hid>/` directory holding a
# `run_params.json`, which is aio-dl.py's own record that a run got far enough
# to be continuable.
#
# WHERE THEY LIVE: aio-dl.py resolves `tmp_<hid>` against the PROCESS CWD (grep
# main_tmp_dir), and configure() chdir's to work_dir — so work_dir is the whole
# search space, and nothing else has to be threaded through.
#
# WHAT RESUME ACTUALLY IS: `--restore-parameters` re-reads every persisted dest
# out of run_params.json, so the resume CLI carries almost nothing. The two
# exceptions are the point of the feature:
#
#   1. --format is DELIBERATELY not persisted (aio-dl.py:get_behavior_params),
#      so the output format can be changed on resume — PDF to CBZ without
#      re-downloading a page. It therefore must ALWAYS be emitted: argparse
#      defaults it to "epub", so omitting it would silently convert a CBZ run.
#   2. The throttle flags come from the CURRENT settings, never the saved ones —
#      a resume may well be running on a worse connection or a hotter device
#      than the run it continues. See resume_throttle_flags.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Takes a JSON ARRAY of paths rather than a single one so "apply to every
    chapter" is ONE call holding the engine lock ONCE. Per-file calls would let
    a download start between files and leave the series half-edited, which is
    the worst of the available outcomes.

    `cover_path` is an on-disk image to embed; "" (the default) leaves each
    archive's existing cover alone. It must be a real filesystem path — a
    picker's `content://` URI cannot be opened by Python, so the caller copies
    the bytes to a cache file first and passes that. Guarded by
    [_cover_path_error], whose containment set is wider than the book guard's
    for exactly that reason; read its docstring before narrowing it.

    A BAD COVER FAILS THE WHOLE CALL rather than being dropped, and that is the
    opposite of how a bad book path is treated below. The asymmetry is
    deliberate: skipping one unwritable archive out of 300 still leaves the
    user better off, but silently ignoring the cover they just picked and
    reporting `{"ok": true}` is a save that lies about what it did.

    Returns `{"ok": true, "written": N, "failed": [{path, error}]}`. A failure
    on one file never aborts the rest — with 300 chapter archives, stopping at
    the first bad one would leave the user worse off than skipping it.

    NOTE embedding a cover REPACKAGES every archive it is applied to, so
    "apply to all chapters" with a cover is far more expensive than the same
    call without one. That is a UI decision, not one this function can make.

# Library root selection
#
# The default root is app-scoped external storage, which needs no permission and
# which Android deletes with the app. A user who wants Komikku or Mihon to READ
# this library has to point it somewhere shared, and that needs
# MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE — see android/README.md for why SAF is not an option
# (it hands back content:// URIs, and Python cannot open() one).
#
# The permission and the folder picking are Kotlin's; what belongs here is the
# question Kotlin cannot answer without Python: "can the downloader actually
# USE this path?" A granted permission is not the same as a writable directory,
# and finding out at the first chapter write is finding out too late.

    consulting os.access, which reports the permission bits and not what the
    Android sandbox will do with them — under scoped storage those two answers
    routinely disagree.

    `seriesCount` is the reassurance half: pointed at an existing library it

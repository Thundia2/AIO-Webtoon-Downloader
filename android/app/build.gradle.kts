// dev/debug scripts (investigate_comix.py, probe_mangafire_vrf.py,
// calibrate_quality_probe.py, _diag_*.py ...). An exclude-list would ship them

// APP VERSION — the desktop's date scheme, plus an Android-only versionCode.
//
// `versionName` is byte-identical to what UI-source/scripts/ci-date-version.js
// prints for the same commit: YYYY.MDD.HMM in UTC, off the COMMITTER timestamp.
// Read that script's header before changing anything here — its reasoning about
// leading zeros, prerelease-suffix inversion and committer-vs-build time applies
// to this file unchanged, and is deliberately not restated. The point of sharing
// the formula is that a desktop installer and an APK built from one commit
// report the SAME version string to a human comparing a bug report.
//
// `versionCode` has no desktop analogue and needs its own derivation, because it
// is the only number Android itself compares: PackageInstaller refuses an APK
// whose versionCode is at or below the installed one, so it must be monotonic in
// release order or updates silently stop working.
//
// WHY MINUTES-SINCE-2020 AND NOT THE OBVIOUS YYYYMMDDHHMM:
//   versionCode is a SIGNED 32-BIT int (hard max 2,147,483,647; Google documents
//   2,100,000,000 as the ceiling). 202608201530 overflows that by ~94x. So does
//   the two-digit-year squeeze YYMMDDHHMM — 2,608,201,530 is still over both
//   caps — which is the variant that LOOKS like it fits and does not. Dropping
//   the year entirely (MMDDHHMM) fits, and stops being monotonic every January.
//
//   Minutes elapsed since 2020-01-01T00:00Z is ~3.49e6 today (commit d1ae7d6 ->
//   3489675) and does not reach 2,100,000,000 for another ~3990 years. It is
//   also MINUTE-resolution, exactly like versionName's HMM component, so the two
//   collide under precisely the same condition — two release commits inside one
//   UTC minute, which ci-date-version.js already argues is moot — instead of one
//   of them silently tolerating what the other cannot express.
//
// Consumed by: core/AppUpdater.kt (BuildConfig.VERSION_CODE is what the update
// feed's `versionCode` is compared against) and the `printVersion` task at the
// bottom of this file, which is how .github/workflows/release.yml learns the
// version to name the APK and to write into android-latest.json. Gradle is the
// single source of truth for the Android version the way ci-date-version.js is
// for the desktop's; CI never recomputes the formula in bash.

// UPDATE FEED + SIGNING — the two facts core/AppUpdater.kt needs baked in.

// FEED: "owner/repo" on GitHub, whose /releases/latest/download/ the updater
// polls. Android's analogue of release.yml's "Point update feed at this repo"
// step, and it follows the same rule: the feed is whichever repo BUILT the APK,
// so a fork-built APK polls the fork. The static default below only ever applies
// to local builds, which never self-update (see RELEASE_SIGNED).
//
// SIGNING: there is no keystore in this repo and there never will be — a private
// key in a public tree is not a key. So `assembleRelease` resolves one of two
// ways:
//   * The four AIO_KEYSTORE_* inputs are present (CI, from repo secrets; see
//     .github/workflows/release.yml) -> sign with the durable release key, and
//     stamp RELEASE_SIGNED = true.
//   * They are absent (every local build, and any CI run on a fork with no
//     secrets) -> sign with the DEBUG key so the APK still installs, and stamp
//     RELEASE_SIGNED = false.
//
// Why debug-signed rather than unsigned: an unsigned APK cannot be installed at
// all (INSTALL_PARSE_FAILED_NO_CERTIFICATES), so "unsigned but honest" is just a
// broken artifact. Why RELEASE_SIGNED must then gate self-update: AGP generates
// ~/.android/debug.keystore per MACHINE, so two CI runs produce two different
// keys, and Android refuses to replace an app with one signed by a different key
// (INSTALL_FAILED_UPDATE_INCOMPATIBLE). A debug-signed build that offered
// updates would download an APK it can provably never install.

// ABIs — a BUILD INPUT, not a build-type property, and that is not a style
// choice. Chaquopy resolves the ABI set it stages Python for from
// `android.defaultConfig.ndk.abiFilters` UNIONED WITH THE PRODUCT FLAVORS, and
// from nothing else — verified by disassembling PythonPlugin.getAbis in
// gradle-17.0.0.jar, which builds a TreeSet from defaultConfig and then walks
// `variant.productFlavors`. Build types are never consulted.
//
// So the obvious "arm64 in defaultConfig, x86_64 added back in buildTypes.debug"
// SILENTLY PRODUCES A BROKEN APK: AGP honours the build type and packages
// lib/x86_64/*.so, while Chaquopy does not and stages only
// requirements-arm64-v8a.imy + stdlib-arm64-v8a.imy. Measured — the debug APK
// came out 56.6 MB with x86_64 native libs and no x86_64 Python runtime at all,
// which is a crash on the first import on an emulator, not a build error.
//
// One list, one place, overridable per invocation instead:
//   * default BOTH, so a local build and the pre-merge CI job stay runnable on
//     an emulator (android/TESTING.md's recipes assume that).
//   * `-PaioAbis=arm64-v8a` / `AIO_ABIS=arm64-v8a` narrows it. release.yml's
//     `android` job sets the env var at JOB level so assembleRelease and
//     printVersion cannot disagree about what shipped.
//
// WHAT DROPPING x86_64 IS WORTH, MEASURED — because the figure previously
// written here and in android/README.md's ABI row was wrong. It does NOT halve
// the APK: it took the release build from 76.79 MB to 50.24 MB, a 34.6% saving.
// The "half" claim came from counting only lib/*.so (~10.3 MB per ABI) and
// missing that the bulk is assets/chaquopy, where the per-ABI split is real but
// uneven (requirements-x86_64.imy 13.06 MB vs requirements-arm64-v8a.imy
// 10.58 MB) and ~12.5 MB is ABI-agnostic (requirements-common + stdlib-common).
//

//   ':app:stagePythonSources' without declaring an explicit [...] dependency.

// Matching by name rather than type because the task class (OutputDirTask) is
// internal to the plugin and not on this script's classpath. The filter is
// broad (every Chaquopy task carries "Python" in its name: mergeXPythonSources,
// generateXPythonAssets, generateXPythonRequirements) so a renamed or added
// task stays covered; the self-exclusion keeps it from depending on itself.
//
// This wiring is self-guarding: if a future Chaquopy renames its tasks out of
// this filter, Gradle raises the same validation error above rather than
// silently packaging a stale copy of the Python sources.

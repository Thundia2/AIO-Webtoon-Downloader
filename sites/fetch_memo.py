"""Per-run fetch memoization for the search / multi-source pipeline.

Owns: FetchMemo — a thread-safe, in-process cache of (site, url) → scraper /
comic context / chapter list, shared across the up-to-four phases of one
search or multi-source operation that all need the SAME data:

    probe (search_orchestrator._probe_one → handler._probe_chapter_aggregate)
      → T3 pairwise (search_orchestrator._run_pairwise_ranking)
        → winner chapter fetch (aio_search_cli._fetch_chapters_for_winner)

Before 2026-07-12 each phase re-fetched fetch_comic_context + get_chapters
from scratch — the winner fetch was the 2nd-3rd network round trip for
identical data, and for comix (browser-driven chapter scrape, 5-50s) each
repeat cost real wall-clock. One FetchMemo per operation (built in
aio_search_cli: run_search_mode / find_alternatives_for_direct_url /
build_alternatives_from_payload) makes phases 2..n in-memory hits.

Deliberate non-goals (user decisions, 2026-07-12):
  - NO cross-process persistence. Chapter lists are the freshest signal we
    have and the user rejected a persistent chapter cache; download spawns
    and resumes re-fetch. This module lives and dies with one process run.
  - NO negative caching. A failed fetch propagates its exception and stores
    NOTHING, so a later phase with a different retry policy (winner fetch's
    bounded-retry shim) gets a genuine fresh attempt instead of a poisoned
    blank. Empty chapter lists likewise aren't stored.

Concurrency model: phases are sequential (probe joins before T3, T3 before
winner fetch) and the probe phase dedupes (site, url) pairs across workers,
so same-key racing is rare; when it happens both threads fetch and
setdefault keeps the first result — a harmless duplicate fetch, never a
corrupt entry. The lock only guards dict access; network calls run outside
it so a slow fetch can't serialize unrelated keys.

Mutation isolation: get_chapters returns a DEEP COPY on every access.
Downstream mutates chapter dicts freely (aio_search_cli strips `_locked`
placeholder entries for alt sources, alignment/downloads stash keys like
`_aux_assets` on them) and those mutations must never leak between phases
or between sources. Contexts are returned by reference — they're treated as
read-mostly by every consumer and sharing them (same object the probe used)
is exactly the reuse we want.

Separate module (not in search_orchestrator) because base.py's probe needs
it too and base ↔ search_orchestrator already dance around a circular
import; a leaf module keeps the dependency graph acyclic and the class
unit-testable without dragging in the orchestrator.

Cross-file (grep fetch_memo):
  - sites/base.py:_probe_chapter_aggregate — probe-side population.
  - sites/comix.py:_probe_chapter_aggregate — same, saves the 5-50s browser
    chapter scrape on reuse.
  - sites/rizzcomic.py — passthrough wrapper.
  - sites/search_orchestrator.py — search_all(fetch_memo=) threads it into
    _probe_one (scrapers) and _run_pairwise_ranking (chapter lists).
  - aio_search_cli.py — builds one per operation, passes it to search_all +
    _fetch_chapters_for_winner; _try_extract_seed_hit pre-populates it via
    put_context/put_chapters (the URL-seed path already paid for that data).

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# MangaFire `vrf` request signer.
#
# What this module owns: minting the `vrf=` query parameter that mangafire.to
# requires on every `/api/*` call since 2026-08. Without it the API answers
# `403 {"message":"Missing token."}`; with a token that doesn't match the
# request's params, `403 {"message":"Invalid token."}`.
#
# Who reads from it: sites/mangafire.py only (grep `sign_api_query`). Nothing
# else should need a vrf.
#
# Depends on: patchright (preferred) or playwright, lazily imported. A run that
# never touches mangafire never launches a browser — the worker thread and the
# Chromium process are both created on first sign, not at import.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHY A BROWSER, when the rest of the handler is a plain JSON client
#
# The token is NOT a hash we could reimplement. It is a stream cipher over the
# request path + serialized query (ciphertext length == plaintext length,
# exactly), and the implementing code ships as a *virtualized bytecode* blob:
# a custom binary deserializer, seed-derived 512-entry opcode permutation
# tables, a VM dispatch loop, plus DisableDevtool anti-analysis. The opcode
# tables re-seed per build, so a transcription would break on every deploy.
#
# So we don't reimplement it — we call it. The signer is an ordinary ES module
# that the site loads, and its export installs an axios REQUEST INTERCEPTOR.
# Handing that export a fake axios instance hands us the interceptor, and
# calling the interceptor with a config yields `config.params.vrf`. Verified
# byte-for-byte against tokens the real site emitted.
#
# WHAT MAKES THIS CHEAP (and why this is not the comix DOM-scrape pattern):
#   * Signing is an in-page function call, NOT a page load. One browser boot
#     per process, then every subsequent sign is a single page.evaluate; a
#     whole chapter list's worth signs in one round-trip via sign_api_queries.
#   * Tokens are session-independent — a token minted here replays fine from a
#     cold, cookieless curl_cffi session. So ONLY the signing needs a browser;
#     all real fetching (and every image download) stays on the fast path.
#   * Tokens carry no timestamp or nonce (the length equality above leaves no
#     room for one), so they never expire and are safely cacheable on disk.
# That is why mangafire keeps EXPENSIVE_PROBE=False and stays a normal search
# participant, instead of paying comix's ~30-90s per-series browser cost.
#
# THE SECOND THING THIS BROWSER NOW DOES: get past Cloudflare, and then serve
# the API reads too. mangafire.to went behind a Managed Challenge sitewide
# (including /api/*) around 2026-08-16, and no headless client can pass it, so
# the browser is the only client that can read this site at all while the
# challenge is up. `fetch_api` does that read same-origin from the cleared page
# — see its docstring for why the alternative (transplanting cf_clearance into
# cloudscraper) is the thing comix already proved does not work. When Cloudflare
# is off, sites/mangafire.py never calls it and the fast path is unchanged.
#
# Cross-file: the daemon-thread + queue bridge below mirrors
# sites/comix.py:_ComixBrowserBridge (grep `_comix_worker_loop`) — Patchright's
# sync API demands that every call run on the one thread that started it, and
# that thread own an asyncio loop, which probe-pool and image-prefetch threads
# satisfy for neither. Keep the two structurally similar.

# How many times to try the channel launch before downgrading the identity.
#
# WHY THIS IS NOT 1: Chromium locks its user-data-dir, and this profile is shared
# by every process the app runs (the Electron app spawns searcher.js and
# downloader.js separately, both carrying PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH). When another
# process holds it, Chrome starts and immediately self-exits — Playwright surfaces
# that as TargetClosedError with `exitCode=21`, which looks nothing like "this
# build doesn't know the channel" but hit the same except branch. The first cut
# downgraded the whole process to channel-less headless on that one transient
# collision, permanently reintroducing the HeadlessChrome client-hint leak for the
# rest of the run. Observed live 2026-08-20; the same launch succeeded on every
# retry afterwards.
#
# These retries are now the SECOND line of defence, not the first: the profile
# lock below means a launch normally happens only when nothing else holds the
# profile. Keep them anyway — the lock is best-effort on an unwritable location,
# and a peer that predates this code still races.

#
# WHY WAITING BEAT RETRYING-THEN-DOWNGRADING (measured 2026-08-20): the two
# launches are different binaries, and only one of them respects the lock —
# `channel="chromium"` is full Chromium and REFUSES a held profile, while the
# channel-less fallback is `chromium_headless_shell` and GETS IN ANYWAY. So under
# contention the fallback was guaranteed to be taken and guaranteed to succeed,
# silently trading the clean identity for one that says HeadlessChrome in
# Sec-CH-UA, userAgentData.brands AND fullVersionList. Cloudflare then never
# auto-clears, and a background op may not ask a human — which is precisely why
# library update checks failed while ordinary downloads kept working.
#
# SIZED AGAINST THE CALLER'S DEADLINE, not against how long a peer might take.
# The desktop update sweep kills a check at 60s (UI-source/electron/main.js, grep
# "Timed out after 60 seconds"), and the wait is only the FIRST thing that budget
# pays for — browser boot, any Cloudflare clear, the bootstrap and the actual API
# reads all come after it. So this deliberately leaves the majority of the 60s to
# the work: waiting the whole budget and then being killed mid-bootstrap is
# strictly worse than failing early with a message that names the real cause.
#
# 25s still covers what waiting can actually fix — a peer running its own check,
# which takes seconds. It cannot rescue a check that collides with a long
# DOWNLOAD holding the profile for minutes, and no value could. The sweep also
# caps browser-backed sites at one in-flight check (grep _SERIAL_BROWSER_SITES),

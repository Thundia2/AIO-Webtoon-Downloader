# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Cross-process exclusive lock over a Chromium user-data-dir.
#
# What this module owns: deciding WHICH process may hold a persistent browser
# profile right now, and making the losers WAIT instead of racing.
#
# Who reads from it: sites/mangafire_vrf.py (grep `profile_lock`). Written to be
# reusable by sites/comix.py, which keeps a persistent profile the same way and
# has the same hazard — so keep mangafire specifics out of here.
#
# Depends on: nothing outside the stdlib.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHY THIS EXISTS (measured 2026-08-20 — not a theoretical race)
#
# Chromium locks a user-data-dir, so exactly one browser may hold a profile.
# The desktop app runs the library update sweep as a POOL of up to 8 concurrent
# `aio-dl.py --list-chapters` PROCESSES (UI-source/electron/main.js, grep
# check-all-updates), several of which land on the same site — so several
# processes reach for one profile at the same instant.
#
# The trap that made this urgent: the two launches are NOT the same binary.
#
#   launch                         binary                   on a locked profile
#   channel="chromium"             chrome.exe (full)        REFUSES (TargetClosedError)
#   default headless (no channel)  chromium_headless_shell  GETS IN ANYWAY
#
# So the "degrade gracefully" fallback was, under contention, GUARANTEED to be
# taken and GUARANTEED to succeed — quietly swapping the one launch that
# presents a clean identity for the one that advertises HeadlessChrome in
# Sec-CH-UA, navigator.userAgentData.brands AND fullVersionList (measured; see
# the table in sites/browser_identity.py). Cloudflare's Managed Challenge then
# refuses to auto-clear, and a background operation may not ask a human — which
# is exactly why update checks failed while ordinary downloads (one uncontended
# process) kept working.
#
# It also meant two browsers writing one cookie jar, which is how a hard-won
# cf_clearance gets clobbered.
#
# The fix is to stop racing: acquire this lock BEFORE launching, so peers queue
# and each in turn gets the good launch. Waiting costs seconds; the fallback
# cost the run its identity.
#
# WHY AN OS-LEVEL LOCK rather than a pid file: the kernel drops it when the
# holder dies, so a killed proc (the Electron app kills these on cancel — grep
# onAbort in main.js) can never strand the profile. There is no stale-lock path
# to garbage-collect, which a pid file would need and would get wrong on pid
# reuse.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Lock objects are per PROFILE PATH, not per caller: two sessions in one process
# must share one lock object, or the second would deadlock against a byte range
# its own process already holds.

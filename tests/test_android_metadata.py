"""Coverage for embedded-metadata editing — aio_android's wrapper AND the
shared metadata_editor module underneath it.

WHY BOTH LAYERS ARE HERE: the wrapper's job is to stop a bad path or a bad
moment from reaching a function that REWRITES the user's archive in place, and
the module's job is to write something the reader can parse. Neither is
observable from the other, and both fail quietly — an unsupported extension
falls straight through metadata_editor's router and reads in the UI as "Save did
nothing".

THE LIST BUG THIS FILE PINS: the setters used to call `value.strip()` directly,
so any list raised AttributeError. LibraryTab.jsx's editor splits Writers /
Pencillers / Genres on commas and sends them as JSON ARRAYS — so every desktop
metadata save that touched those three fields failed outright. `_as_text` is the
fix and these are the regression tests; see the module header for why the
collapse happens in one place rather than in each format writer.

Cross-file: metadata_editor.py, metadata_cli.py (the desktop's subprocess
route), UI-source/src/components/LibraryTab.jsx:MetadataEditorPanel (the caller
that sends the arrays), android/.../ui/screens/SeriesDetailScreen.kt.

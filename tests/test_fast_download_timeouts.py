"""Coverage for the fast image-download path's timeout + retry semantics.

WHY THIS EXISTS (bench/linewebtoonlogs.md, 2026-08-20): curl_cffi's scalar
``timeout=`` sets only ``CurlOpt.TIMEOUT_MS`` — a TOTAL-transfer deadline —
while ``requests``/cloudscraper give the identical number per-read STALL
semantics on aio-dl.py's slow path. So one ``--http-timeout 30`` meant two
different things, and the sites routed through the fast path (linewebtoon,
mangafire) had every large page guillotined mid-transfer no matter how healthy
the connection was. 17 of the 18 failures in that log were transfers still
making progress, one at 670472 of 678424 bytes. Two such pages then failed a
chapter's zero-tolerance gate and --multi-source replaced a 120-page official
LINE Webtoon chapter with a 103-page third-party re-host.

The regression is invisible to any test that mocks the HTTP layer: the bug is
in WHICH CURL OPTIONS get set, and a mock never sets them. So these assert on
the option dicts directly, plus live-socket tests against a local server that
trickles a body slower than a total deadline would allow.

Cross-file: sites/base.py (_fast_dl_stall_options / _fast_dl_retry_options /
fast_download_images), aio-dl.py's two call sites (grep fast_attempts).
